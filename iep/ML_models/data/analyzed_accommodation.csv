To help this student, you can modify the lesson plan by focusing less on the language of the objectives and instead providing visual aids for the students. This can include the use of physical objects to represent the fractions, manipulatives such as coins or dollar bills, or graphic organizers to illustrate the concepts. You can also provide additional instructions related to dividing a dollar into different parts using visuals rather than complicated language. Additionally, you can incorporate a predictable, structured, and consistent learning environment by making sure that the student understands expectations and employs strategies to focus their attention, such as fidgeting or scheduling."

To help this student, I could modify the lesson plan by breaking up larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps with explicit instructions and visual aids. This would provide a predictable, structured, and consistent learning environment, while also providing the student with some additional support in breaking down more complex concepts.

To modify the lesson plan to help the student, I suggest extending the length of the lesson to allow for additional visual communication methods and more time to engage with written material during the five senses scavenger hunt.

Additionally, providing visuals such as diagrams and pictures and allowing for frequent breaks can help the student focus and stay engaged with the lesson."

The modification I can make to the lesson plan to help this student with dysgraphia is to reduce the use of written assignments and instead allow for more activities that use the computer.

Additionally, I will incorporate activities such as arranging objects on a tactile grid, using labels for objects and tactile diagrams for understanding the lesson material.

I can also add subtitles, captions, and resources, as well as breaking up the assignment into smaller parts, providing visual cues such as graphic organizers, pictures, and manipulatives, and providing flexible deadlines. This will help the student better understand the grammar material, including conjunctions, possessive pronouns, complete sentences, articles, etc."

In order to address the student's needs while teaching the lesson plan, I suggest modifying it to include the use of alternative forms of communication such as sign language and communication devices, as well as visual aids, manipulatives, and graphic organizers to aid in comprehension of the text. Additionally, the student should be given a quiet work environment, and the lesson objective should be modified to include an emphasis on analyzing and understanding story elements and developing abilities to share, explain, and discuss ideas related to the text."

To modify the lesson plan to help the student with environmental sensitivities, I would adjust the classroom environment to make it more comfortable for them. This could include setting up a special air filtration system, allowing for flexible seating positions to accommodate the student, and providing visual supports throughout the lesson. Additionally, I would adjust the lesson plan objectives to focus on verbal communication and comprehension rather than written work. This can include modeling and demonstrating speaking patterns, having students practice responses to various questions, and emphasizing understanding of grammar and usage through oral activities."

To help the student with executive function disorder in the lesson plan, I would modify the objective to include providing a free workspace for the student. Additionally, I would create a structure that reduces distractions by providing breaks and encouraging quiet work, as well as using visual aids, manipulatives, and graphic organizers to facilitate comprehension and analysis."
